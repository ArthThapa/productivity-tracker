## The Problem

Being productive is a very essential part of our life and keeping track of what task(s) you're doing can be a really good way to become more productivity and focusing on task at hand at a time is a very necessary thing because multitasking decreases our productivity by a landslide, even I have suffered it, it's not health.
<br>
  <I>That's exactly what accountability dashboard does</I>
  
 Accountability Dashboard was made with idea of keeping track of Only ONE big task that one wants to achieve in a month and breaks down each month to 4 weeks, that way user don't have to input the data each week and lazy out from the whole tracking thing.
 
 ## How it works

- It uses google's oauth for verfication and user system since everyone has google accounts.
- User's set the goal for their month and expected targets for each week ie 4 targets per month
- After end of each week they can input the amount of task they did in the week and add comments too if they feel like so.
- A graph will be generated simultaneously so they can picturize the data easily.
